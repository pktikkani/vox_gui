# Summary of Fixes Applied

## 1. Fixed Decryption Error

**Root Cause**: The server was creating a new `CryptoSession` with a dummy shared secret `[0; 32]` after authentication, instead of using the actual shared secret from the key exchange. This caused encryption/decryption keys to mismatch between client and server.

**Fix**: 
- Modified server to ensure key exchange happens before authentication
- Server now stores the session with the correct crypto session established during key exchange
- Added validation to ensure authentication cannot happen before key exchange

## 2. Fixed Compiler Warnings

### Unused Imports:
- Removed `Duration` from `auth.rs`
- Removed `anyhow::Result` from `auth.rs`
- Removed `Message` import from `server/connection.rs`
- Removed `AuthRequest` from `server.rs`
- Removed `AsyncWrite` from `server.rs`
- Removed `warn` from `server.rs`

### Unused Mut:
- Removed unnecessary `mut` from `socket` parameter in `handle_client` function

### Dead Code:
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes to `ClientSession.id` and `ClientSession.token` fields
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute to `Connection.stream` field

## 3. Added Tests

Created comprehensive crypto tests to verify:
- Key exchange produces identical shared secrets on both sides
- Encryption/decryption works correctly in both directions
- Nonces are unique for each encryption operation

## Files Modified:
1. `/src/common/auth.rs` - Removed unused imports
2. `/src/server/connection.rs` - Removed unused import
3. `/src/server/server.rs` - Fixed decryption error and removed unused imports/mut
4. `/src/client/connection.rs` - Added allow(dead_code) for unused field
5. `/tests/crypto_test.rs` - Added new test file

All compiler warnings have been resolved and the decryption error has been fixed. The application should now properly establish encrypted connections between client and server.
